Z score and T score are used in statistics and are referred to as standard scores. They indicate how many SD an observation in a data is above or below the mean. 

When you know the **population standard deviation** and **population mean** for a population, it is better to use Z test. When you do not have all this information and instead have sample data, it is prudent to go for T test. In Z test, you compare a sample to a population. On the other hand, T test can be performed for a single sample, two distinct samples that are different and not related or for two or more samples that are matching. When the sample is large (n greater than 30), Z- score is normally calculated but T-score is preferred when the sample is less than 30. This is because you do not get a good estimate of the standard deviation of the population with a small sample and this is why a T score is better.
