By the end of self driving car nano degree first semaster, Udacity provide one lesson on using github properly. They provide some good advice on maintaining a github profie. 

###General Information for a good profile
- Have a professional GitHub name
- Have a professional profile photo (recommended to be a photo of myself, but could also be stylized).
- Profile information is up to date. Includes at least one up-to-date links for: 'URL' and/or 'Company' fields and/or ‘Contact Email’ and current location.
- Trying to keep active on regular basis. The darker green means contribute intensively over one day. However continous light blue means a user has a steady github usage, passionate about coding.

### Good documentation
- Projects have meaningful names
- A completed README that says what the purpose of the project is, any instructions about how to use or view it, and what kind of collaboration is sought.
Not all forked repos/changes require modifications to the README, especially when contributing upstream to another's project (would need to be a substantial change). All changes should be documented with commit messages to explain the changes.


### Contributing to popular open source libraries
